<td>in fortnite a key detail is building because building pretects you from enemy's shooting you.</td>
<td>fortnite recently came out with a game mode called zero build which is where there is no building in game. this means that your accuracy needs to be better and you will need to hide behind trees, houses and hide in bushes.</td>
<td>also keep in mind that in zero build there is something called over sheild. in a build game you would have 100 health and 100 sheild but over sheild gives you 50 extra sheild that recharges over time which makes it harder to kill enemy's. it would usually take 1 to 2 more bullets to kill the enemy.</td>
